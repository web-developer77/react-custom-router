A `Route` is used to declaratively map routes to your application's
component hierarchy.

Props
-----

### `path`

The path used in the URL.

It will concat with the parent route's path unless it starts with `/`.
In which case you will need to use `childWillMatch` on the parent route
so the router knows to keep going down the route tree.

If left undefined, the router will try to match the child routes.

Please refer to the [Path Matching Guide][path-matching] to learn more
about supported path matching syntax.

### `component`

A single component to be rendered when the route matches the url. It can
be rendered by the parent route component with `this.props.children`.

#### Example

```js
var routes = (
  <Route component={App}>
    <Route path="groups" components={Groups}/>
    <Route path="users" components={Users}/>
  </Route>
);

var App = React.createClass({
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* this will be either <Users> or <Groups> */}
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

### `components`

Routes can define multiple components as an object of name:component
pairs to be rendered when the path matches the url. They can be rendred
by the parent route component with `this.props[name]`.

#### Example

```js
var routes = (
  <Route component={App}>
    <Route path="groups" components={{main: Groups, sidebar: GroupsSidebar}}/>
    <Route path="users" components={{main: Users, sidebar: UsersSidebar}}>
      <Route path="users/:userId" components={Profile}/>
    </Route>
  </Route>
);

var App = React.createClass({
  render () {
    // the matched child route components become props in the parent
    return (
      <div>
        <div className="Main">
          {this.props.main}
        </div>
        <div className="Sidebar">
          {this.props.sidebar}
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var Users = React.createClass({
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* if at "/users/123" this will be <Profile> */}
        {/* UsersSidebar will also get <Profile> as this.props.children */}
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

### `getComponents(state, cb)`

Same as `components` but asynchronous, useful for code-splitting and
returning different routes given some transition `state`.

#### `callback` signature

`cb(err, component)`

#### Example

```js
<Route path="coures/:courseId" getComponents={(cb) => {
  // do asynchronous stuff to find the components
  cb(null, [Course]);
}}/>
```

### `children`

Routes can be nested, `this.props.children` will contain the element
created from the child route component. Please refer to the
[overview][overview] since this is a very critical part of the router's
design.

### `onEnter(nextState, router)`

Called when a route is about to be entered. It provides the next router
state and the router instance for cancelling/redirecting the transition.

### `onLeave(nextState, router)`

Called when a route is about to be exited. It provides the next router
state and the router instance for cancelling/redirecting the transition.
