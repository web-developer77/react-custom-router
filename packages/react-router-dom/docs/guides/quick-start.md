## Create React App

The easiest way to get started with a React web project is with a tool
called Create React App, a Facebook project with a ton of community
help.

## Installation

React Router DOM is published to [npm](https://npm.im/react-router-dom) so you can install it with either `npm` or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com).

```sh
npm install react-router-dom@next
# or
yarn add react-router-dom@next
```
