# History Mixin

Adds the router's `history` object to your component instance.

**Note**: You do not need this mixin for route components, its already
available as `this.props.history`. This is for components deeper in the
render tree that need access to the router's history object.

### Methods

#### `pushState(state, pathname, query)`

Transitions to a new URL.

##### arguments

- `state` - the location state.
- `pathname` - the full url with or without the query.
- `query` - an object that will be stringified by the router.

#### `replaceState(state, pathname, query)`

Replaces the current URL with a new one, without affecting the length of
the history (like a redirect).

##### arguments

- `state` - the location state.
- `pathname` - the full url with or without the query.
- `query` - an object that will be stringified by the router.

#### `go(n)`

Go forward or backward in the history by `n` or `-n`.

#### `goBack()`

Go back one entry in the history.

#### `goForward()`

Go forward one entry in the history.

#### `createPath(pathname, query)`

Stringifies the query into the pathname, using the router's config.

#### `createHref(pathname, query)`

Creates a URL, using the router's config. For example, it will add `#/` in
front of the `pathname` for hash history.

#### `isActive(pathname, query)`

Returns `true` or `false` depending on if the current path is active.
Will be true for every route in the route branch matched by the
`pathname` (child route is active, therefore parent is too).

##### arguments

- `pathname` - the full url with or without the query.
- `query` - an object that will be stringified by the router.

### Examples

```js
import { History } from 'react-router'

React.createClass({

  mixins: [ History ],

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div onClick={() => this.history.pushState(null, '/foo')}>Go to foo</div>
        <div onClick={() => this.history.replaceState(null, 'bar')}>Go to bar without creating a new history entry</div>
        <div onClick={() => this.history.goBack()}>Go back</div>
     </div>
   )
 }
})
```

Let's say you are using bootstrap and want to get `active` on those `li`
tags for the Tabs:

```js
import { Link, History } from 'react-router'

let Tab = React.createClass({

  mixins: [ History ],

  render() {
    let isActive = this.history.isActive(this.props.to, this.props.query)
    let className = isActive ? 'active' : ''
    return <li className={className}><Link {...this.props}/></li>
  }

})

// use it just like <Link/>, and you'll get an anchor wrapped in an `li`
// with an automatic `active` class on both.
<Tab href="foo">Foo</Tab>
```

### But Iâ€™m using Classes

If you aren't happy using `createClass` for a handful of components in
your app for the sake of the `History` mixin, have a couple of options:

- Pass `this.props.history` from your route components down to the
  components that need it.

- Use context

```js
import PropTypes from 'react-router'
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  doStuff () {
    this.context.history.pushState(null, '/some/path')
  }
}
MyComponent.contextTypes = { history: PropTypes.history }
```

- [Make your history a module](/docs/advanced/NavigatingOutsideOfComponents.md)

- Create a higher order component, we might end up shipping with this
  and deprecating history, just haven't had the time to think it through
  all the way.

```js
function connectHistory (Component) {
  return React.createClass({
    mixins: [ History ],
    render () {
      return <Component {...this.props} history={this.history} />
    }
  })
}

// other file
import connectHistory from './connectHistory'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  doStuff () {
    this.props.history.pushState(null, '/some/where')
  }
}

export default connectHistory(MyComponent)
```
