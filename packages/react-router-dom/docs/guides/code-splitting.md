# Code Splitting

One great feature of the web is that we don't have to make our visitors
download the entire app before they can use it. You can think of code splitting
as incrementally downloading the app. To accomplish this we'll use [webpack],
[`babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import`], and [`react-loadable`].

[webpack] has built-in support for [dynamic imports][import]; however, if you
are using [Babel] (e.g., to compile JSX to JavaScript) then you will need to
use the [`babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import`] plugin. This is a syntax-only
plugin, meaning Babel won't do any additional transformations. The plugin
simply allows Babel to parse dynamic imports so webpack can bundle them as a
code split. Your `.babelrc` should look something like this:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "react"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "syntax-dynamic-import"
  ]
}
```

[`react-loadable`] is a higher-order component for loading components with
dynamic imports. It handles all sorts of edge cases automatically and makes
code splitting simple! Here's an example of how to use [`react-loadable`]:

```js
import loadable from 'react-loadable';
import Loading from './my-loading-component';

// components load their module for initial visit
const About = (props) => (
  <Bundle load={loadAbout}>
    {(About) => <About {...props}/>}
  </Bundle>
)

const Dashboard = (props) => (
  <Bundle load={loadDashboard}>
    {(Dashboard) => <Dashboard {...props}/>}
  </Bundle>
)

class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // preloads the rest
    loadAbout(() => {})
    loadDashboard(() => {})
  }

export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <LoadableComponent/>;
  }
}
```

That's all there is to it! Simply use `LoadableComponent` (or whatever you
named your component) and it will automatically be loaded and rendered when you
use it in your application. The `loader` option is a function which actually
loads the component, and `loading` is a placeholder component to show while the
real component is loading.

## Code Splitting and Server-Side Rendering

[`react-loadable`] includes [a guide for server-side rendering][ssr]. All you
should need to do is include [`babel-plugin-import-inspector`] in your
`.babelrc` and server-side rendering should just workâ„¢. Here is an example
`.babelrc` file:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "react"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "syntax-dynamic-import",
    ["import-inspector", {
      "serverSideRequirePath": true
    }]
  ]
}
```
