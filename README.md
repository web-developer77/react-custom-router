Declarative routing for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-router@next

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel
import { BrowserRouter, Match, Link } from 'react-router'

// not using an ES6 transpiler
var BrowserRouter = require('react-router').BrowserRouter
var Match = require('react-router').Match
var Link = require('react-router').Link
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-router@next/umd/react-router.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactRouter`.
