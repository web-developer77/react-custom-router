# Welcome to React Router

**Please note: These docs are currently very much a work in progress. If you are interested in lending a hand, please contact [@mjackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson) directly on Twitter or just go ahead and find a TODO, complete it, and make a PR. Thanks!**

Welcome to the React Router docs! If you're reading this, you're probably browsing [our docs on GitHub](/docs). You're welcome to keep reading here, or you may prefer browsing them on [our website](#TODO). Either way, we hope you find them useful!

The docs are currently divided up into the following sections:

- [Installation](installation)
- [Getting Started](installation/getting-started.md)
- [Advanced Guides](advanced-guides)
- [Tutorial](tutorial)
- [API Reference](api-reference.md)
- [Contributing](contributing.md)
- [FAQ](faq.md)

If you're not sure where to begin, our [Getting Started guide](installation/getting-started.md) is a great place to start!

If you're looking for past versions of the docs, they are all on GitHub and versioned with everything else alongside the actual code.

- [React Router v4/5 docs](#TODO)
- [React Router v3 docs](#TODO)
